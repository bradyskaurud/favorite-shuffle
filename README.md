## Favorite Shuffle

All the popular music streaming services out there today revolve around the idea of discovering new songs, new artists, etc. This is how the "radio" feature of any of the popular music providers works, always adding in new songs from artists or genres it thinks you would like to listen to. However, what if I just want a mixed up playlist of ONLY the aritsts I've choosen to listen to, not new artists. This is what FavoriteShuffle is all about.
